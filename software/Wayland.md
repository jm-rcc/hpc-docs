Wayland is a project to define a protocol for a compositor to talk to
 its clients as well as a library implementation of the protocol.  The
 compositor can be a standalone display server running on Linux kernel
 modesetting and evdev input devices, an X application, or a wayland
 client itself.  The clients can be traditional applications, X servers
 (rootless or fullscreen) or other display servers.
