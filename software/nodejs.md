Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime
 for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an
 event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient,
 perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.
