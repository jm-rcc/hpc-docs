Zstandard is a real-time compression algorithm, providing high compression ratios.
 It offers a very wide range of compression/speed trade-off, while being backed by a very fast decoder.
 It also offers a special mode for small data, called dictionary compression, and can create dictionaries
 from any sample set.
