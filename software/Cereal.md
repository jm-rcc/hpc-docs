cereal is a header-only C++11 serialization library. cereal takes arbitrary data types and reversibly
turns them into different representations, such as compact binary encodings, XML, or JSON. cereal was designed to be
fast, light-weight, and easy to extend - it has no external dependencies and can be easily bundled with other code or
used standalone.
