>The LLVM Core libraries provide a modern source- and target-independent  
> optimizer, along with code generation support for many popular CPUs  
> (as well as some less common ones!) These libraries are built around a well  
> specified code representation known as the LLVM intermediate representation  
> ("LLVM IR"). The LLVM Core libraries are well documented, and it is  
> particularly easy to invent your own language (or port an existing compiler)  
> to use LLVM as an optimizer and code generator.
