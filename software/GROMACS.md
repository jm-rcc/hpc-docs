>GROMACS is a versatile package to perform molecular dynamics, i.e. simulate the  
>Newtonian equations of motion for systems with hundreds to millions of  
>particles.    
>    
>This is a GPU enabled build, containing both MPI and threadMPI builds  
>for both single and double precision.    
>    
>It also contains the gmxapi extension for the single precision MPI build  
>next to PLUMED.
