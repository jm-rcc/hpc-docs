GROMACS is a versatile package to perform molecular dynamics, i.e. simulate the
Newtonian equations of motion for systems with hundreds to millions of
particles.

This is a GPU enabled build, containing both MPI and threadMPI builds
for both single and double precision.

It also contains the gmxapi extension for the single precision MPI build
next to PLUMED.

GROMACS is a versatile package to perform molecular dynamics, i.e. simulate the
Newtonian equations of motion for systems with hundreds to millions of
particles.

This is a CPU only build, containing both MPI and threadMPI binaries
for both single and double precision.

It also contains the gmxapi extension for the single precision MPI build.
