GCTA (Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis) is a software package, which was
 initially developed to estimate the proportion of phenotypic variance explained
 by all genome-wide SNPs for a complex trait but has been extensively extended
 for many other analyses of data from genome-wide association studies (GWASs).
