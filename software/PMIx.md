>Process Management for Exascale Environments  
>PMI Exascale (PMIx) represents an attempt to  
>provide an extended version of the PMI standard specifically designed  
>to support clusters up to and including exascale sizes. The overall  
>objective of the project is not to branch the existing pseudo-standard  
>definitions - in fact, PMIx fully supports both of the existing PMI-1  
>and PMI-2 APIs - but rather to (a) augment and extend those APIs to  
>eliminate some current restrictions that impact scalability, and (b)  
>provide a reference implementation of the PMI-server that demonstrates  
>the desired level of scalability.
