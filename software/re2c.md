>re2c is a free and open-source lexer generator for C and C++. Its main goal is generating  
>fast lexers: at least as fast as their reasonably optimized hand-coded counterparts. Instead of using  
>traditional table-driven approach, re2c encodes the generated finite state automata directly in the form  
>of conditional jumps and comparisons.
