CP2K is a freely available (GPL) program, written in Fortran 95, to perform atomistic and molecular
 simulations of solid state, liquid, molecular and biological systems. It provides a general framework for different
 methods such as e.g. density functional theory (DFT) using a mixed Gaussian and plane waves approach (GPW), and
 classical pair and many-body potentials.
