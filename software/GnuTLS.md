>GnuTLS is a secure communications library implementing the SSL, TLS  
> and DTLS protocols and technologies around them. It provides a simple  
> C language application programming interface (API) to access the secure  
> communications protocols as well as APIs to parse and write X.509, PKCS #12,  
> OpenPGP and other required structures. It is aimed to be portable  
> and efficient with focus on security and interoperability.
