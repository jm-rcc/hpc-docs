GnuTLS is a secure communications library implementing the SSL, TLS
 and DTLS protocols and technologies around them. It provides a simple
 C language application programming interface (API) to access the secure
 communications protocols as well as APIs to parse and write X.509, PKCS #12,
 OpenPGP and other required structures. It is aimed to be portable
 and efficient with focus on security and interoperability.
