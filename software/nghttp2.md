This is an implementation of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol version 2 in C.

The framing layer of HTTP/2 is implemented as a reusable C library.
On top of that, we have implemented an HTTP/2 client, server and proxy.
We have also developed load test and benchmarking tools for HTTP/2.

An HPACK encoder and decoder are available as a public API.
