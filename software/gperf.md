>GNU gperf is a perfect hash function generator. For a given list of strings,  
> it produces a hash function and hash table, in form of C or C++ code, for  
> looking up a value depending on the input string. The hash function is  
> perfect, which means that the hash table has no collisions, and the hash  
> table lookup needs a single string comparison only.
