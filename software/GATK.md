The Genome Analysis Toolkit or GATK is a software package developed at the Broad Institute
 to analyse next-generation resequencing data. The toolkit offers a wide variety of tools,
 with a primary focus on variant discovery and genotyping as well as strong emphasis on
 data quality assurance. Its robust architecture, powerful processing engine and
 high-performance computing features make it capable of taking on projects of any size.
