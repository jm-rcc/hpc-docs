JupyterLab is the next-generation user interface for Project Jupyter offering all the familiar
 building blocks of the classic Jupyter Notebook (notebook, terminal, text editor, file browser, rich outputs,
 etc.) in a flexible and powerful user interface. JupyterLab will eventually replace the classic Jupyter
 Notebook.
