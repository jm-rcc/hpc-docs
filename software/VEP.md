## Description  
Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) determines the effect of your
 variants (SNPs, insertions, deletions, CNVs or structural variants) on genes,
 transcripts, and protein sequence, as well as regulatory regions.
 Includes EnsEMBL-XS, which provides pre-compiled replacements for frequently
 used routines in VEP.
