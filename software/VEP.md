Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) determines the effect of your
 variants (SNPs, insertions, deletions, CNVs or structural variants) on genes,
 transcripts, and protein sequence, as well as regulatory regions.
 Includes EnsEMBL-XS, which provides pre-compiled replacements for frequently
 used routines in VEP.
