OpenJPEG is an open-source JPEG 2000 codec written in
 C language. It has been developed in order to promote the use of JPEG 2000,
 a still-image compression standard from the Joint Photographic Experts Group
 (JPEG). Since may 2015, it is officially recognized by ISO/IEC and ITU-T as
 a JPEG 2000 Reference Software.
