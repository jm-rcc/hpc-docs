>The GNU Readline library provides a set of functions for use by applications  
> that allow users to edit command lines as they are typed in. Both Emacs and  
> vi editing modes are available. The Readline library includes additional  
> functions to maintain a list of previously-entered command lines, to recall  
> and perhaps reedit those lines, and perform csh-like history expansion on  
> previous commands.
