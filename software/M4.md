## Description  
GNU M4 is an implementation of the traditional Unix macro processor. It is mostly SVR4 compatible
  although it has some extensions (for example, handling more than 9 positional parameters to macros).
 GNU M4 also has built-in functions for including files, running shell commands, doing arithmetic, etc.
