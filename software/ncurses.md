## Description  
The Ncurses (new curses) library is a free software emulation of curses in
 System V Release 4.0, and more. It uses Terminfo format, supports pads and
 color and multiple highlights and forms characters and function-key mapping,
 and has all the other SYSV-curses enhancements over BSD Curses.
