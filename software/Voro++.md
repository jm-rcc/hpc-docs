## Description  
Voro++ is a software library for carrying out three-dimensional computations of the Voronoi  
  
tessellation. A distinguishing feature of the Voro++ library is that it carries out cell-based calculations,  
  
computing the Voronoi cell for each particle individually. It is particularly well-suited for applications that  
  
rely on cell-based statistics, where features of Voronoi cells (eg. volume, centroid, number of faces) can be used  
  
to analyze a system of particles.
