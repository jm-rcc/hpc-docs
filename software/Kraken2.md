>Kraken is a system for assigning taxonomic labels to short DNA sequences,  
> usually obtained through metagenomic studies. Previous attempts by other  
> bioinformatics software to accomplish this task have often used sequence  
> alignment or machine learning techniques that were quite slow, leading to  
> the development of less sensitive but much faster abundance estimation  
> programs. Kraken aims to achieve high sensitivity and high speed by  
> utilizing exact alignments of k-mers and a novel classification algorithm.
