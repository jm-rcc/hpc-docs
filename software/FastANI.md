>FastANI is developed for fast alignment-free computation of  
> whole-genome Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI). ANI is defined as mean  
> nucleotide identity of orthologous gene pairs shared between two microbial  
> genomes. FastANI supports pairwise comparison of both complete and draft  
> genome assemblies.
