>HUMAnN v3 is a pipeline for efficiently  
> and accurately determining the coverage and abundance  
> of microbial pathways in a community from metagenomic data.  
>Sequencing a metagenome typically produces millions  
> of short DNA/RNA reads. This process, referred  
> to as functional profiling, aims to describe the metabolic potential  
> of a microbial community and its members. More generally,  
> functional profiling answers the question:  
> What are the microbes in my community-of-interest doing (or capable of doing)?
