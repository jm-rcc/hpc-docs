HUMAnN v3 is a pipeline for efficiently
 and accurately determining the coverage and abundance
 of microbial pathways in a community from metagenomic data.
Sequencing a metagenome typically produces millions
 of short DNA/RNA reads. This process, referred
 to as functional profiling, aims to describe the metabolic potential
 of a microbial community and its members. More generally,
 functional profiling answers the question:
 What are the microbes in my community-of-interest doing (or capable of doing)?
