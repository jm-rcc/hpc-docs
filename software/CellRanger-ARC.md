>Cell Ranger ARC is a set of analysis pipelines that process  
> Chromium Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression sequencing data to generate a  
> variety of analyses pertaining to gene expression, chromatin accessibility and  
> their linkage. Furthermore, since the ATAC and gene expression measurements are on  
> the very same cell, we are able to perform analyses that link chromatin  
> accessibility and gene expression.
