>Lua is a powerful, fast, lightweight, embeddable scripting language.  
> Lua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description constructs based  
> on associative arrays and extensible semantics. Lua is dynamically typed,  
> runs by interpreting bytecode for a register-based virtual machine,  
> and has automatic memory management with incremental garbage collection,  
> making it ideal for configuration, scripting, and rapid prototyping.
