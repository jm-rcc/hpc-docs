>The Portable Hardware Locality (hwloc) software package provides a portable  
> abstraction (across OS, versions, architectures, ...) of the hierarchical  
> topology of modern architectures, including NUMA memory nodes, sockets, shared  
> caches, cores and simultaneous multithreading. It also gathers various system  
> attributes such as cache and memory information as well as the locality of I/O  
> devices such as network interfaces, InfiniBand HCAs or GPUs. It primarily  
> aims at helping applications with gathering information about modern computing  
> hardware so as to exploit it accordingly and efficiently.
