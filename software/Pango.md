>Pango is a library for laying out and rendering of text, with an emphasis on internationalization.  
>Pango can be used anywhere that text layout is needed, though most of the work on Pango so far has been done in the  
>context of the GTK+ widget toolkit. Pango forms the core of text and font handling for GTK+-2.x.
