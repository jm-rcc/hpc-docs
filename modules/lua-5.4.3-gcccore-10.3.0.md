# Lua 5.4.3  
![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/class-lang-D7D1CC)  
  
  
Lua is a powerful, fast, lightweight, embeddable scripting language.
 Lua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description constructs based
 on associative arrays and extensible semantics. Lua is dynamically typed,
 runs by interpreting bytecode for a register-based virtual machine,
 and has automatic memory management with incremental garbage collection,
 making it ideal for configuration, scripting, and rapid prototyping.
