Open Knowledgebase of Interatomic Models.  
  
KIM is an API and OpenKIM is a collection of interatomic models (potentials) for

to get access to the models in the OpenKIM database.  
  
This EasyBuild only installs the API, the models can be installed with the
package openkim-models, or the user can install them manually by running
    kim-api-collections-management install user MODELNAME
or
