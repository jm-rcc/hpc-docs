 D-Bus is a message bus system, a simple way for applications to talk
 to one another.  In addition to interprocess communication, D-Bus helps
 coordinate process lifecycle; it makes it simple and reliable to code
 a "single instance" application or daemon, and to launch applications
 and daemons on demand when their services are needed.
