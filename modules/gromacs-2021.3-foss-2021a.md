![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/class-bio-D7D1CC)  
  
  

GROMACS is a versatile package to perform molecular dynamics, i.e. simulate the
Newtonian equations of motion for systems with hundreds to millions of
particles.

This is a CPU only build, containing both MPI and threadMPI builds
for both single and double precision.

It also contains the gmxapi extension for the single precision MPI build.
