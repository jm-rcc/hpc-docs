# re2c 2.2 
![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/class-tools-D7D1CC)  
  
  
re2c is a free and open-source lexer generator for C and C++. Its main goal is generating
fast lexers: at least as fast as their reasonably optimized hand-coded counterparts. Instead of using
traditional table-driven approach, re2c encodes the generated finite state automata directly in the form
of conditional jumps and comparisons.
