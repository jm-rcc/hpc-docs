# Autoconf 2.71  
![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/class-devel-D7D1CC)  
  
  
Autoconf is an extensible package of M4 macros that produce shell scripts
 to automatically configure software source code packages. These scripts can adapt the
 packages to many kinds of UNIX-like systems without manual user intervention. Autoconf
 creates a configuration script for a package from a template file that lists the
 operating system features that the package can use, in the form of M4 macro calls.
