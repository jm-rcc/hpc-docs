 GNU gperf is a perfect hash function generator. For a given list of strings,
 it produces a hash function and hash table, in form of C or C++ code, for
 looking up a value depending on the input string. The hash function is
 perfect, which means that the hash table has no collisions, and the hash
 table lookup needs a single string comparison only.
