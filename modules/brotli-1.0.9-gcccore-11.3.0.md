# Brotli 1.0.9  
![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/class-lib-D7D1CC)  
  
  
Brotli is a generic-purpose lossless compression algorithm that compresses data using a combination
 of a modern variant of the LZ77 algorithm, Huffman coding and 2nd order context modeling, with a compression ratio
 comparable to the best currently available general-purpose compression methods. It is similar in speed with deflate
 but offers more dense compression.
The specification of the Brotli Compressed Data Format is defined in RFC 7932.
