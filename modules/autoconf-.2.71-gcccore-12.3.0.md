# Autoconf 2.71  
![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/class-devel-D7D1CC)  
  
  

 Autoconf is an extensible package of M4 macros that produce shell scripts
 to automatically configure software source code packages. These scripts can
 adapt the packages to many kinds of UNIX-like systems without manual user
 intervention. Autoconf creates a configuration script for a package from a
 template file that lists the operating system features that the package can
 use, in the form of M4 macro calls.
