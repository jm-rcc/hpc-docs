# libunwind 1.6.2  
(lib)  
  
The primary goal of libunwind is to define a portable and efficient C programming interface
 (API) to determine the call-chain of a program. The API additionally provides the means to manipulate the
 preserved (callee-saved) state of each call-frame and to resume execution at any point in the call-chain
 (non-local goto). The API supports both local (same-process) and remote (across-process) operation.
 As such, the API is useful in a number of applications
