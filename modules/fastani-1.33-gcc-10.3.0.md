FastANI is developed for fast alignment-free computation of
 whole-genome Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI). ANI is defined as mean
 nucleotide identity of orthologous gene pairs shared between two microbial
 genomes. FastANI supports pairwise comparison of both complete and draft
 genome assemblies.
