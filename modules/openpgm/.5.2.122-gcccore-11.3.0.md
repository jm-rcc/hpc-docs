# OpenPGM 5.2.122  
(system)  
  
OpenPGM is an open source implementation of the Pragmatic General Multicast
 (PGM) specification in RFC 3208 available at www.ietf.org. PGM is a reliable
 and scalable multicast protocol that enables receivers to detect loss, request
 retransmission of lost data, or notify an application of unrecoverable loss.
 PGM is a receiver-reliable protocol, which means the receiver is responsible
 for ensuring all data is received, absolving the sender of reception
 responsibility.
